Award-winning gospel musician Togarepi Chivaviro will this month stage shows in Mozambique, the United Kingdom and Australia as his music career continues to blossom following the launch of his latest album, Ebenezer-Tiri Munyasha 2. BY ARTS CORRESPONDENTChivaviro, who is set to jet into the country today from his base in South Africa, is also expected to headline the Ebenezer-Tiri Munyasha Celebration Festival to be held at Harare Gardens on September 17.The gospel music fiesta is meant to celebrate the success of the song Ebenezer after it was recently voted the Best Collaboration song on the continent during the TAGMA awards in South Africa.Local gospel artistes Noel Zembe, Mechanic Manyeruke, Lawrence Haisa, Kudzai Nyakudya and Blessing Shumba are set to perform at the festival.Chivaviro told NewsDay yesterday that the UK show will see him sharing the stage with popular South African gospel musician Sipho Makhabane at a gig dubbed Ebenezer meets Ebenezer .Makhabane also has a hit song called Ebenezer. Its amazing how people are responding to our music ministry. A lot of invitations from across the globe are coming our way and our bookings calendar is packed. When we sing, we also share the Word in the process. Therefore, it s more than just shows for us but ministry, he said. It s also an honour for us to be singing in four countries, three different continents all in one month. After our Mozambique and Zimbabwe mission, we will be in the UK for a once-off show with Sipho Makhabane on September 26, and conclude the month in Melbourne, Australia. It s our first time in the Australian continent and we are very excited to be ministering there in song. On Friday, Chivaviro, Mathias Mhere, Bethany Pasinewako and Gamuchirai Magadzire will perform alongside Mozambican musicians at Chimoio Stadium during an all-night vigil organised by the Word of Prophecy Ministry.
