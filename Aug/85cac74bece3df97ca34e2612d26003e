Thank you a million times, at least there is a reason to smile after All, he said. A million thank yous for a million views. The video has received attention from MTV Base and is already on the Zambezi Magic Zim Top 10 charts. With Jah Prayzah s latest album, Mudhara Vachauya, having been received with mixed feelings, Watora Mari seems to have become his saving grace.
