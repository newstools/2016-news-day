We are only three weeks in the market and our projection is that we would want to have at least 10% of the market in the sub premium segment over the next two years, thereafter, get about 30% of the market, he said. The uptake has been great. People love the new pack and we have improved on the smoke on what we have seen on the market. So the quality is good and the price is affordable. To our trade partners, there is a good margin for them and they are taking it and loving it. So we foresee ourselves growing rapidly at rate we did envisage. The menthol has taken off well, people have loved it as it is a smooth smoke.
