Gold producer Metallon Gold Zimbabwe plans to ramp output to 500 000 ounces per annum in five years buoyed by expansion work at its five mines, a senior executive has said. BY BUSINESS REPORTEROutput was 97 000 ounces in 2015 and the gold producer is targeting an output of 120 000 ounces this year.Metallon s technical director Isadore Matunhire told journalists during a tour of the mine yesterday that the 500 000 output would be underpinned by expansion works at its five gold mines under its wings.Metallon runs five mines How Mine, Arcturus, Shamva, Redwing and Mazowe. Arcturus is currently under care and maintenance.He said the gold producer would commission New Sands plant at Mazowe mine in October.The group has 8,3 million ounces of gold in reserves. At the current extraction rate of 100 000 ounces per annum, it means the reserves would last for 83 years. It means we are going to increase production, which will create employment. Our plan is that in the next five years, we would have achieved 500 000 ounces, he said. At each operation, there is a project we are embarking on to increase output. At that extraction rate, it means, the group would mine for 20 years.Matunhire said the $20 million New Sands plant at Mazowe would process 65 000 tonnes per month and generate 1 900 ounces. The plant is 95% complete.Matunhire was optimistic the 500 000 output target would be met. It will take lot of work. It will require a lot of capital, but we are prepared and geared for that, he said.Mazowe Mine manager Oswald Makonese said he was happy the expansion focus of the group had started at the mine, adding that Mazowe is going to be the centre and focus of gold mining in Zimbabwe in the not-too-distant future.
