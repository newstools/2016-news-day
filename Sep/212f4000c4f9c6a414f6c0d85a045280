WARRIORS legend, Ronald Gidiza Sibanda had still not gone home yesterday, although he was spotted in Bulawayo. BY FORTUNE MBELESibanda was reported missing on Thursday, but his mother Sithokozile Sibanda yesterday said they had made contact with him.Sibanda left home on Sunday purportedly to watch Highlanders against How Mine in a Premier Soccer League match at Barbourfields Stadium, but never returned and his mother made a police report on Thursday morning.She said she was relieved that her son had been spotted in the city. He (Ronald) is yet to come home, but I hear he has been seen around. He must be embarrassed to come home, but I know he will eventually come, she said.His brother, former Highlanders coach Bongani Mafu, confirmed Sibanda was safe.Mafu said he understood Sibanda had travelled to Beitbridge and had been recently active on social media sites, although his phone number remained unreachable.The family was prompted to make a police report after Sibanda s phone was switched off shortly after being answered by a person, who said the football legend was asleep.Fearing the worst, Sibanda s mother also checked with hospitals and mortuaries for him to no avail.
