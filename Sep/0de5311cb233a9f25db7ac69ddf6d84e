The Union for the Development of Apostolic Churches in Zimbabwe (Udaciza) has launched a gender-based violence (GBV) and gender equality policy targeting apostolic and Zionist churches, which for long have been accused of being some of the perpetrators of GBV. By Phyllis MbanjeThe policy was formulated as part of a project called Preventing Violence Against Adolescent Girls and Young Women, which is being implemented by World Vision Zimbabwe (WVZ), UN Women and Danida as supporting partners.Speaking at the launch yesterday, Women Affairs and Gender deputy minister Abigail Damasane said the policy would effectively empower Udaciza and affiliated church leaders to transform religious communities and congregations to be active agents of change in the elimination of violence against women and girls. The policy seeks to discourage adverse religious beliefs and practices, thereby, encouraging faith-based communities to be more gender-sensitive and responsive to gender equality and the GBV needs of their respective communities, she said.Damasane said this would enhance the capacity of the church to engage in GBV prevention activism, to speak out on positive faith-based norms and the unacceptability of the crime. The formulation of this policy is in line with Section 56(3) of the Constitution, which outlaws unfair treatment of any person on the grounds of sex, gender, culture, religious beliefs, marital status, age, disability, economic or social status, among others, she said. Udaciza secretary-general, Edson Tsvakai said practices such as virginity testing for girls and forced and child marriages should be done away with. We are committed to seeing this change, he said.WVZ director, Ish Emmanuel said GBV was increasingly become an issue of concern among faith communities, as some religious beliefs and practices were often used to justify or perpetuate violence against women and girls. According to a gender-based analysis undertaken by WVZ last year, religious leaders were identified as the main first port of call for GBV victims, he said.
