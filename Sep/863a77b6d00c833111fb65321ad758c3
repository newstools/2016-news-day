The Zimbabwe crowd is amazing, as it grows each and every time I come to perform here. It is so amazing to perform for such a crowd away from home, she said.Bucie praised Ammara, whom she described as a talented musician, having listened to her music hours before her performance.She said she attributed her success in music to God and her ability to be herself, saying she was not in competition and urged artistes to be original if they were to create their own brands. God is the only secret to success. I trust in Him (God) and the talent that He gave me. My mother, who is a pastor, is also my inspiration and she always supports my career, she said.Bucie said she would be releasing her yet-to-be-named album next month, on which she is working with a Zimbabwean producer.The concert goes to Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo this Saturday, with dancehall musician, Winky D, leading the line-up of local performers, who will share the stage with South African artistes, Bucie and DJ Zinhle.Also to feature at the concert will be comedian Babongile Sikhonjwa, house music group, Djembe Monks, wheel spinners DJ Liz and DJ Slamma.Delta Beverages marketing manager, Patricia Murambinda, said Golden Pilsener has had a long and successful history in music, mainly through its involvement with Harare International Festival of the Arts over the years. The Golden Pilsener Afro-fusion concerts are new and fresh to the brand and are set to be one of a kind shows not to be missed, bringing in a unique fusion of artistes and music. Afro-fusion is a genre, which blends traditional African rhythms with contemporary music to create a hybrid music style, she said.
