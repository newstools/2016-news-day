ZIMBABWE S three-member national amateur golf team will next week head for the World Amateur Team Championship without an accompanying coach due to financial constraints, the Zimbabwe Golf Association (ZGA) said yesterday. BY DANIEL NHAKANISOThe bi-annual World Amateur Team Championship, commonly known as the Eisenhower Trophy to be played from September 21 to 24 at the Iberostar Playa Paraiso Golf Club, Riviera Maya in Mexico.Zimbabwe will be represented by the talented youthful trio of Ben Follett-Smith, Kieran Vincent and David Amm, while the ZGA president Mafingei Nyamwanza will be the head of delegation.But it is the absence of a national team coach in the travelling delegation, which has raised a few eyebrows after ZGA decided to send Nyamwanza ahead of veteran coach, Roger Baylis, whose presence might have been more valuable to the players.In a statement, Nyamwanza blamed the coach s absence from the travelling delegation on lack of sponsorship. All preparations (for the tournament) have gone well so far. The only challenge remains, that of resources with very limited sponsorships for these kind of very important and high-profile tournaments where the country showcases it s very best, he said. Limited resources have seen the association cut the delegation to only the players and the head of delegation. Ordinarily, a coach would be essential to have in the delegation, but this could not be so. Zimbabwe are making a return to the Eisenhower Trophy after missing the previous edition of the tournament held in Japan after the ZGA leadership failed to enter the team before the stipulated entry deadline.The three-member team of Follet-Smith, Vincent and Amm were selected following gruelling series of qualifying tournaments held in Zvishavane, Bulawayo and Harare between May and June. The duo of Vincent and Follet-Smith are currently of golf scholarships at the Liberty University and Mississippi State University in the United States respectively, while Amm has been on brilliant form on the local circuit.Zimbabwe last competed at the Eisenhower Trophy at the 2012 edition held in Turkey, finishing in a five-way tie for 17th with Wales, Poland, Thailand and Netherlands at the 73-team tournament on three-under-par 425.
