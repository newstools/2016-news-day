Harare magistrate, Bianca Makwande yesterday relaxed reporting conditions for the five war veterans leaders accused of undermining President Robert Mugabe s authority following a successful application by their lawyers. BY MARY TARUVINGAZimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association secretary-general, Victor Matemadanda, deputy chairperson, Headman Moyo, spokesperson, Douglas Mahiya, political commissar, Francis Nhando and Harare deputy chairperson, Hoyini Samuel Bhila will now be reporting to the police once a fortnight instead of the hitherto twice a week.Makwande ruled that there was need for the State to strike a balance with the accused, considering that three of them live out of Harare.The five were arrested and charged following the release of a damning communiqu in July, which urged Mugabe to step down.However, they are denying undermining Mugabe s authority, arguing the 92-year old leader was not immune to criticism.They also distanced themselves from the communiqu , saying it was unfair for the State to allege they crafted it when it was not handwritten.Nhando and his alleged accomplices are being represented by lawyers Beatrice Mtetwa, Harrison Nkomo and David Druly.The lawyers argued that the reporting conditions were strenuous on the war veterans finances considering that they earned peanuts. The lawyers also said their clients were illegally placed on remand.The State s allegations are that the communiqu released on July 22 had defamatory statements, thereby undermining Mugabe s authority. The State will on September 13 make its response to constitutional issues raised by Mtetwa.Tapiwa Kasema is representing the State.
