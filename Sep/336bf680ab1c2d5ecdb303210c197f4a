THE grand finale of Miss Curvy Zimbabwe 2016, which was slated for August, has now been moved to October 8 after it was incorporated into the Harare International Carnival, pageant founder, Mercy Catwalk Mushaninga has said. BY WINSTONE ANTONIOThe beauty pageant, which seeks to celebrate women with fuller figures, has been held over the last few years. Mushaninga told NewsDay yesterday that Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA) incorporation of Miss Curvy Zimbabwe into the fiesta was a positive move set to open doors for them. We moved our pageant (Miss Curvy Zimbabwe 2016 finale) after Zimbabwe Tourism Authority permitted us to be part of the forthcoming Harare International Carnival, that will see our 16 curvy queens participating at the Carnival Street Walk in line with our theme Showcasing our Culture, she said. Participating at the festival will provide us with the platform to showcase the other side of beauty on a global stage, as this year s edition of the pageant is not just going to be a one night event. It is going to be a week full of cultural exchange, ahead of October 8, which will be the crowning ceremony. Her dream, Mushaninga said, was to take the pageant to Brazil in 2018. She said the final contestants have started working on their different projects like cultural talent, traditional food research and orphans in the community in line with their theme.In a recent interview, ZTA spokesperson, Sugar Chagonda said there would be entertainment galore, as a series of pre-events have been line-up ahead of the main festival in collaboration with various private players in the entertainment industry
