THE United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Global Fund have strengthened their partnership with additional funding of $143 million to help scale up the fight against HIV in Zimbabwe, a Press release said this week. XinhuaHIV remains a major public health challenge in the country with 1,4 million people living with HIV at the end of 2015. Even though Zimbabwe has seen one of the sharpest declines in HIV prevalence in the region, at 15% it remains among the highest HIV prevalence rates in the world.The HIV grant aims to increase access to HIV treatment, with a particular focus on the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, expanding HIV testing and counselling services, and scale up of prevention for adolescents and in and out of school youth. This timely new funding will sustain and strengthen existing HIV prevention and treatment services in Zimbabwe, said Bishow Parajuli, UN resident co-ordinator and UNDP resident representative in Zimbabwe. Significant advances have been made in recent years, but we must not be complacent, Parajuli said. Services must continue if we are to further reduce the rate of new HIV infections while also increasing the number of people initiated on to HIV treatment. Implemented by UNDP, in partnership with the Ministry of Health and Child Care, the National AIDS Council and civil society organisations, the new funding will run from January 2017 through December 2017, said the Press release. The $143 million are additional funding to the Global Fund s existing HIV grant to Zimbabwe, taking the grant total to $611 million, the Press release said.Zimbabwe has made great strides in the fight against Aids, with the support of UNDP, the Global Fund and other development partners. The existing HIV grant supports 880 000 people in Zimbabwe to access life-saving HIV treatment.Between 2014 and 2015, retention of patients on HIV treatment has increased from 87% to approximately 90%, while the proportion of HIV-positive infants born to HIV-positive mothers has declined from 18% to 4% in the same period, corresponding to 14 000 new HIV infections of children being averted.The grant will be key to reducing the impact of the HIV epidemic and ensuring healthy lives for all, contributing to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3 on ensuring health and well-being for all.
