ELEPHANTS believed to have escaped from Hwange National Park in search of food have reportedly wreaked havoc in Binga, where they are destroying crops and threatening villagers lives. BY LINDA CHINOBVAVillagers in the area, who spoke to Southern Eye, said they were living in fear. As villagers, we are worried by the increasing number of elephants in our area. They are destroying our vegetables in our gardens and vandalising our granaries. They are now subjecting us to hunger and poverty, Moses Mpande, a villager, whose three granaries were destroyed by elephants last month, said. As it is, the elephants are feeding on our garden produce and we are left with nothing. Mavis Sibindi said the jumbos were destroying the few crops they managed to harvest last summer. Our area is well-known for poor harvests and this is making our hunger tales even worse. Our children are going to school on empty stomachs as there is nothing to give them, she said.Villagers said despite attempts to scare away the elephants using drums and hand-made cymbals, the animals continued to feed on their crops. We also fear the elephants might demolish our pole-and-mud huts, since they have managed to destroy granaries, the elephants might resort to destroying our huts in search of food, Trymore Mwinde said.The villagers appealed to the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority to urgently intervene and drive away the wild animals. The authorities should save us from this ordeal. They should at least deploy rangers to the affected areas, who will ensure the safety of the villagers because we cannot deal with this problem on our own. We are not trained for that, Vinson Mwinde said.Binga councillor, Themba Munkombwe, said he was aware of the challenge faced by villagers and he was yet to engage Zimparks officials over the matter.Zimparks spokesperson, Caroline Washaya-Moyo could not be reached for comment yesterday.
