Sri Lanka Development 346 and 185 for 5 beat Zimbabwe Development 349 and 177 all-out by five wickets THE Zimbabwe Development side made their Sri Lankan counterparts sweat for victory, with Carl Mumba again turning in a sterling bowling performance, but in the end, the visitors proved the better team, with a five-wicket victory shortly after lunch on the final day at Harare Sports Club yesterday. ZimCricketThe Sri Lankans started the final day with 38 runs on the board and a wicket down, needing 181 to win.Opening batsman, Pabasara Waduge, on 22, and night-watchman, Anuk Fernando, yet to score, opened the batting to the pace bowling of Victor Nyauchi and Mumba.Fernando was the more aggressive of the two, particularly against Nyauchi, who was not up to the same standard he showed at the start of their first innings.Mumba took the first wicket of the day when he trapped Waduge lbw for 30 with a fine full-length delivery, leaving the score at 69 for 2.Luke Jongwe replaced Nyauchi, and struck almost immediately, as Lahiru Milantha (6) drove a low catch into the covers, to make the score 84 for 3.Fernando escaped a low chance in the slips off Mumba on three, while Charith Asalanka showed more aggression than in his first innings, hitting two early boundaries off Mumba.Mumba got his man, however, as he burst through Asalanka s defence and bowled him comprehensively for nine, making the score 97 for four.Zimbabwe were in now with hope for victory, with Mumba the potential match-winner, but he had already bowled for more than an hour without a break.Sri Lanka s 100 came in the 25th over.Sandun Weerakkody was in fine form, as in the first innings, and the Zimbabweans urgently needed to remove him, but Mumba had to be rested and Nyauchi came back to take his place.Weerakkody laid into the left-arm spin of Wellington Masakadza, hitting him for 18 runs in two overs, and the Sri Lankans were now closing in on victory.However, on 35 off 39 balls, he went for a big leg-side swish off Nyauchi and was caught at the wicket; 141 for 5. The score at lunch was 145 for five, with Fernando on 38 and Rumesh Buddika two.Fernando pulled the first ball after lunch, from Nyauchi, for four, as the Sri Lankans set their sights on victory. Fernando is clearly better than the average night-watchman he reached his 50 off 64 balls, but immediately after that, with the total at 165, he was dropped by the wicketkeeper, Nyasha Mayavo off Nyauchi.This was the Zimbabweans last sniff of victory, as Fernando sealed the win with a six over the leg-side boundary off the bowling of Dylan Hondo.Fernando finished on 61 and Buddika 15. They put on an unbroken stand of 44, and if the Zimbabweans had been able to dismiss either early, the result might have been different.Mumba, who bowled superbly throughout the match to take eight wickets altogether, finished with 2 for 54 in this innings, and Jongwe 2 for 25.
