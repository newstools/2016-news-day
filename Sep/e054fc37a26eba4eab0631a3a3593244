THE United States government says it has introduced mechanisms to guard against politicisation of its food aid in Zimbabwe. BY PHYLLIS MBANJEIn a statement last Friday, the US embassy said the United States Agency for International Development (USAid) had introduced robust mechanisms to ensure its aid does not land in wrong hands. Our food commodities can be distinguished from other sources by their packaging, which is marked with the American flag and USAid logo. USAid also channels all food aid through WFP (World Food Programme) and other non-governmental organisations, and the food goes directly to the beneficiaries with no intermediary, the embassy said.The agency said it will carefully monitor food distribution to ensure the aid gets to its intended beneficiaries. Other measures include use of suggestion boxes and a help desk at all food distribution points, as well as a toll-free hotline to help expose politicians bent of abusing food aid as a campaign tool. We will continue to actively investigate any and all reports of possible political manipulation of US government food assistance, USAid said.The Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC) recently released a damning report on the politicisation of food aid, particularly in Bikita East, Mazowe Central, Muzarabani North and some parts of Buhera. Since June 2015, the US government has contributed $117 million in response to the El Ni o-induced drought in Zimbabwe to meet immediate food security needs, while also building resilience against future droughts.
